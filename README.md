# DataSciencePortfolio
Hi, my name is Kamal Saltani; welcome to my Data Science repository. This collection of projects highlights my understanding and implementation of key concepts in Machine Learning (ML) and Inferential Statistics. Through the various projects presented here, I aim to demonstrate my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world data science problems.

During my academic journey, I have had the privilege of studying at prestigious institutions such as MIT and Lewis University, where I gained a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of data science. At MIT, I deepened my knowledge in advanced machine learning techniques, statistical modeling, and algorithm design, while at Lewis University, I focused on real-world applications of data science in diverse domains. This blend of cutting-edge coursework and hands-on experience has provided me with a robust skill set, including:

- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Techniques in supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and ensemble methods, with hands-on experience implementing models from scratch.
- **Statistical Inference & Hypothesis Testing**: Applying inferential statistics to analyze data, conduct hypothesis testing, and validate models.
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Methods for data cleaning, normalization, handling missing data, and feature selection to ensure high-quality data for analysis.
- **Optimization & Regularization**: Implementing techniques such as stochastic gradient descent, Lasso, and Ridge regression for efficient model training and overfitting prevention.
- **Data Visualization & Model Interpretability**: Utilizing visualization tools and techniques like Matplotlib and seaborn for model transparency and interpretation.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Developing algorithms with an emphasis on time and space complexity, learned through algorithmic problem-solving exercises.

Despite my limited professional experience, this portfolio serves as a testament to my readiness to contribute to the field of data science by showcasing my ability to apply these skills to real-world problems. It highlights my commitment to continuous learning and best practices, ensuring that I am well-prepared to tackle complex challenges in the industry.
